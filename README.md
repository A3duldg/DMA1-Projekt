//An application to manage the lending of your LP records to friends is to be developed. The application will store information about your friends and your LP collection, including multiple copies of the same LP.

//Key features of the application include:

//· Friend Management: Add, search, update, and delete friend profiles.

//· LP Management: Add new LPs, seach, update information, and delete LPs. You can also register multiple copies under the same title.

//· Loan Tracking: Track which friends have borrowed specific LP copies, along with the loan date and return status. The system will allow you to register when an LP is returned.

//When a friend wishes to borrow an LP, they can browse your collection and select a specific copy. You then register the loan in the system, recording both the friend and the chosen LP copy.
